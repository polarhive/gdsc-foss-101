## Prerequisites

Download this repository as a zip file by clicking [here](https://github.com/polarhive/gdsc-foss-101/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Ensure that Python is installed on your machine so you can run these files.

## 1: Binary to ASCII

```
python cursor.py
```

Take a closer look, in smaller chunks!

```
python ascii.py
```

## 2: Flipping bits

## 3: Exploring source-code

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save this to a `.py` file and run it.

## 4. Generating bytecode

```
python -m compileall helloworld.py
```

Look for a folder named `__pycache__` and check for a .pyc file, which is typically tagged with your Python version number.

## 4: Back to Binary

```
python bin.py
```

Let's compare that to

```
binary_string="0110111001100101011101100110010101110010001000000110011101101111011011100110111001100001001000000110011101101001011101100110010100100000011110010110111101110101001000000111010101110000"
```
